  In AdonisJS, routes are defined in the start/routes.ts file and serve as a combination of a URI
  pattern and a handler for requests. Here are some key points about AdonisJS routes: Definition:
  Routes are defined in the start/routes.ts file, where you can create a combination of a URI
  pattern and a handler for specific requests. 1 Dynamic Parameters: You can define dynamic
  parameters in your routes, allowing for URLs that can accept dynamic values, such as /:id for an
  ID parameter. 2 HTTP Methods: AdonisJS supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for
  defining routes, allowing you to handle different actions in your application. 1 Wildcard
  Parameters: You can define wildcard parameters using the * keyword to capture all segments of a
  URI. 2 Rendering Views: You can use the router.on().render() method to render views without
  defining an explicit handler. 2 For more detailed information, you can refer to the official
  AdonisJS documentation. 1 3 Sources
